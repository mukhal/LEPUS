# LEPUS :rabbit2: : Prompt-based Unsupervised Multi-hop Reranking for Open-domain QA

We propose an approach for unsupervised re-ranking of multi-hop document paths for open-domain QA. LEPUS constructs a prompt that consists of **(i) an instruction** and **(ii) the path** and uses a language model to score paths as probability of generating the question given the path.
